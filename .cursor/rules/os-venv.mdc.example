## Terminal environment

- **OS/shell**: Commands run in **PowerShell on Windows**.

## Dependency/environment management

- **Conda-only**: Use conda for environment and dependency management.
- **Required env**: Always activate the conda environment **`data-etl-dagster`** before running commands.

```powershell
conda activate data-etl-dagster
```

## Failure handling

- **Install errors**: If an installation error occurs, **stop** and ask the user for help (do not continue).
