# Agent Docs Index

Use the closest `AGENTS.md` for local rules first. This folder holds deeper
context that is shared across services and libraries.

## Start here
- Root overview: `AGENTS.md`
- Dagster pipelines: `services/dagster/etl_pipelines/AGENTS.md`
- Data model contracts: `libs/models/AGENTS.md`

## Reference docs
- `docs/agents/platform.md` - platform invariants and data contracts (summary)
- `docs/agents/architecture.md` - high-level system flow
- `docs/agents/pipelines.md` - pipeline behavior and join rules
- `docs/agents/testing.md` - test expectations and commands
